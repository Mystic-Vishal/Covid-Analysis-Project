# Covid analysis

This project is done on Covid-19 Data. Which contains number of cases, total deaths , number of vaccinations etc. type of fields. 

In this project I have done data exploration and data cleanup using SQL (T-SQL).
Later i have used those insight to do data visualisation using Tableau.

[Attaching all the files in this repo itself.]

**CovidDeaths** and **CovidVaccinations** are the main excels used for the data exploration.
**Covid_Analysis.sql** contain the TSQL code for that.

Whereas **Tableau Tables** (1 to 4) are used in data visualisation in tableau.
